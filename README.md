  <h1>🎄 Advent of Code Journey 🎄</h1>
</div>

## 🧠 My Approach

My journey through these puzzles is guided by a few personal principles:

* My goal isn't to write the most "perfect" or optimized code. I am using these challenges to sharpen my problem-solving skills and my programming fundamentals.
* I am **not using AI** to generate solutions/code. Every logic and algorithm is handcrafted to ensure I am actually learning the "why" behind the "how."
* I started this journey in February 2026. I am working through past challenges until the new 2026 problems are released in December.
* I am currently tackling these puzzles using Python, though I may switch or experiment with other languages later as I progress.
